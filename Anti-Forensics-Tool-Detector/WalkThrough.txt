# 🧪 AFID – Anti-Forensic Intelligence Detector (v1.0)

Hey folks 👋

This is a tool I built for those who are into digital forensics, CTFs, and cyber investigations. **AFID** is designed to detect signs of anti-forensics — things like secure deletion (e.g., via `shred` or `BleachBit`), timestomping, log tampering, or general evidence-wiping behavior.

I built this mainly for use on **Kali Linux**, but it should run fine on any Linux distro with Python 3.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Checks for suspicious timestamp changes (timestomping)
- Verifies SHA-256 hash of the file
- Looks for missing “sensitive” files that might have been wiped
- Scans for signs of `shred`/BleachBit usage in logs
- Checks extended attributes (like immutability flags)
- Detects log file tampering (if logs are accessible)
- Saves everything in a clean JSON report inside the `tools` folder
